   For behold, from henceforth : all generations shall call me blessed.<br>
   For he that is mighty hath magnified me : and holy is his Name.<br>
   And his mercy is on them that fear him : throughout all generations.<br>
   He hath showed strength with his arm : he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
   He hath put down the mighty from their seat : and hath exalted the humble and meek.<br>
   He hath filled the hungry with good things : and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br>
   He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel : as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.<br>
   Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.";
