    <p>I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty,<br>
      Maker of heaven and earth :</p>
    <p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:<br>
      Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br>
      Born of the Virgin Mary:<br>
      Suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
      Was crucified, dead, and buried:<br>
      He descended into hell; <br>
      The third day he rose again from the dead: <br>
      He ascended into heaven, <br>
      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: <br>
      From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
    <p>I believe in the Holy Ghost: <br>
      The holy Catholick Church; <br>
      The Communion of Saints: <br>
      The Forgiveness of sins: <br>
      The Resurrection of the body, <br>
      And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p></div>
