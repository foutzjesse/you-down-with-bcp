 <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven,<br>

            Thy kingdom come.<br>
            Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.<br>

            And lead us not into temptation;<br>
            But deliver us from evil:<br>
            For thine is the kingdom,<br>
            The power, and the glory,<br>

      I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty,<br>
      Maker of heaven and earth :</p>
    <p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:<br>
      Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br>
      Born of the Virgin Mary:<br>
      Suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
      Was crucified, dead, and buried:<br>
      He descended into hell; <br>
      The third day he rose again from the dead: <br>
      He ascended into heaven, <br>
      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: <br>
      From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
    <p>I believe in the Holy Ghost: <br>
      The holy Catholick Church; <br>
      The Communion of Saints: <br>
      The Forgiveness of sins: <br>
      The Resurrection of the body, <br>
      And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p></div>

        <h2>A Prayer for All Conditions of Men</h2>
        <p>O GOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men: that thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations. More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholick Church; that it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life. Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those, who are any ways afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate; [especially ________] that it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities, giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.
        </p>
    </div>
        
    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
