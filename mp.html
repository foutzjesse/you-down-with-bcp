    <p>OUR Father, which art in heaven,<br>
            Hallowed be thy Name.<br>
            Thy kingdom come.<br>
            Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.<br>
            Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
            And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
            As we forgive them that trespass against us.<br>
            And lead us not into temptation;<br>
            But deliver us from evil:<br>
            For thine is the kingdom,<br>
            The power, and the glory,<br>
            For ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <p>I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty,<br>
      Maker of heaven and earth :</p>
    <p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:<br>
      Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br>
      Born of the Virgin Mary:<br>
      Suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
      Was crucified, dead, and buried:<br>
      He descended into hell; <br>
      The third day he rose again from the dead: <br>
      He ascended into heaven, <br>
      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: <br>
      From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
    <p>I believe in the Holy Ghost: <br>
      The holy Catholick Church; <br>
      The Communion of Saints: <br>
      The Forgiveness of sins: <br>
      The Resurrection of the body, <br>
      And the Life everlasting. Amen.</p>

    <p>O LORD, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
