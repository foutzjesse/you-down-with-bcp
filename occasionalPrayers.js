  and hearty thanks for all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us, and to all men; [particularly ________]. 
  We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above all, 
  for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. 
  And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, 
  and that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives; by giving up ourselves to thy service, 
  and by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days; 
  through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.`;

  We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table.<br>
  But thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy:<br>
  Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his blood,<br>
  that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and our souls washed through his most precious blood,<br>
  and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.</p>`;

  And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto thee;
  humbly beseeching thee, that all we, who are partakers of this holy Communion, may be fulfilled with thy grace and heavenly benediction.<br>
  
  And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service;
  not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord;
  by whom, and with whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ;<br>
  and dost assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people;<br>
  and are also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of thy dear Son.<br>
  And we most humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in;<br>
  through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.</p>`;
